# Vabadu Enhancement Proposals (VEPs)

> :warning: **WARNING:** this proposal system is experimental now, the process is a subject to change.

The main goal of Vabadu Enhancement Proposals is to provide a convenient and formal way to propose changes to Vabadu DAO
and standardize ways of interaction between different parts of DAO.

Proposal management is done using GitHub pull requests, the process is described formally in [VEP-1](https://github.com/orgs/Vabadu-DAO/discussions/2).

## Creating VEP
1. Discuss your proposal with community first, for example in [Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/Vabadu-DAO/discussions).
2. Read [VEP-1](https://github.com/orgs/Vabadu-DAO/discussions/2) to understand proposal management process.
3. Fork this repo and copy `./0000-template.md` to `./text/0000-my-new-proposal.md` where "my-new-proposal" is a short title of your VEP.
4. Fill all sections and answer questions stated in template. If you need to include images, upload them to `./assets/0000-my-new-proposal/` folder.
5. Submit a pull request.
