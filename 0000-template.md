# Summary

Which feature this document introduces? Describe it in one paragraph.

# Motivation

Which problem we address? Why it is important to make a new VEP?

# Guide

Explain this document in simple language, as if you were teaching it to another developers. Give examples how your feature will work in real life.

# Specification

This section describes your feature formally. It contains requirements, which must be followed in order to implement your VEP. To keep things formal, it is convenient to follow [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt). You should include following text at the beginning of this section:

> The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. How the problem stated in "Motivation" section was solved in another blockchains? This section encourages you as an author to learn from others' mistakes. Feel free to include links to blogs, books, example TON whitepaper, manifest TON CON etc.

# Unresolved questions
